My BTC Tracker
A professional web application to track my Bitcoin (BTC) purchases, inspired by saylortracker.com. This app reads my transaction data from a CSV file, calculates total BTC holdings, invested amount, current value, and gains/losses based on real-time Bitcoin prices, and displays the data in a sleek, black-themed dashboard. It also aims to include a historical price chart with purchase plotting (currently in progress).

Live Demo

You can view the live app at: https://mjamiv.github.io/btc_tracker/

Features

Displays total BTC owned, total USD invested, current value, and unrealized gain/loss in a professional dashboard layout.
Shows a table of purchase history with timestamps, BTC amounts, and costs.
Pulls live Bitcoin prices from the CoinGecko API.
(In Progress) Visualizes historical Bitcoin prices with a line chart and overlays purchase points, sized by USD cost, similar to saylortracker.com.
Black-themed UI with a modern, business-like aesthetic.

Note: The chart section is currently not rendering due to an issue (see Known Issues).

Data Format

Total (inclusive of fees and/or spread): Total USD spent per transaction.
Prerequisites

A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
Internet access (to fetch live BTC prices and historical data).
A GitHub Pages setup for hosting (already configured for this repo).
Setup

Clone the Repository
bash
Wrap
Copy
git clone https://github.com/mjamiv/btc_tracker.git
cd btc_tracker
Prepare Your CSV
Ensure your transaction data is saved as transactions.csv in the root directory.
Match the column headers exactly as shown above (case-sensitive).
Install Dependencies
No manual installation needed! The app pulls dependencies via CDNs:
PapaParse for CSV parsing.
Chart.js for graphing.
chartjs-adapter-date-fns for time scale support.
Host Locally (Optional)
To test locally, use a local server to avoid CORS issues:
bash
Wrap
Copy
npx http-server
Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.
Alternatively, view the live demo on GitHub Pages (see Live Demo).
Deploy to GitHub Pages
The app is already set up for GitHub Pages. Simply push changes to the main branch:
bash
Wrap
Copy
git add .
git commit -m "Update BTC Tracker"
git push origin main
GitHub Pages will automatically deploy the updated site.
Usage

Visit the live demo (https://mjamiv.github.io/btc_tracker/) or open index.html locally via a server.
The app automatically:
Loads transactions.csv from the GitHub repository.
Fetches the current Bitcoin price from CoinGecko.
Calculates and displays your stats (Total BTC, Invested, Current Value, Gain/Loss).
Renders a table of your purchase history.
Attempts to render a historical price chart (see Known Issues).
Click the "Refresh" button to update the data.

Example Output

Stats:
Total BTC: 0.61186380
Total Invested: $38,444.97
Current Value: $57,688.36
Gain/Loss: +$19,243.39
Table: Lists each purchase with date, BTC amount, and cost.
Chart (In Progress): Will show a gold line for BTC price over time with green dots for purchases, sized by USD cost.
Known Issues

Chart Not Rendering: The historical price chart (intended to show BTC price over time with purchase points) is not displaying. Likely causes:
CORS issues with the CoinGecko historical price API (/coins/bitcoin/market_chart).
Missing or incompatible Chart.js date adapter.
Data mismatch between purchase dates and historical price data.
Resolution Plan:
Check browser console for errors (e.g., CORS, fetch failures).
Test with a CORS proxy for development (e.g., cors-anywhere).
Consider alternative APIs (e.g., CoinCap) if CoinGecko issues persist.
Verify Chart.js setup and data formatting.
Future Enhancements

Fix the historical price chart to display BTC price trends and purchase points.
Add zooming and panning to the chart for better interactivity.
Include additional stats (e.g., average purchase price, percentage gain).
Add CSV upload functionality for dynamic data updates.
Implement periodic price refresh without manual button clicks.
